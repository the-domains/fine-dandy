            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Mido Eyewear Show 2016</h1><p>While you might not have heard of it, Italy's Mido Eyewear Show is the leading event for eyewear professionals. It's an exhibition during which major international brands present their new styles and innovations for prescription specs and sunglasses-and, while it might sound like it's purely for industry members, it's fascinating for anybody interested in fashion and design.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e0e4e7f9c24bc25e24721945becf5f7aec28e9a0.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>3sixteen + Herman Miller</h1><p>LES-based raw denim fiends 3sixteen advocate skilled craftsmanship and longevity-which is why they often post photos of their customers' faded, worn-in jeans after years of use. Thus, their special collaboration with design manufacturer Herman Miller makes perfect sense, as there's a shared commitment to inspiring through timeless, dependable design.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f04a92fd70ba0596ea6b8079424cfee8970ec89c.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bits And Pieces - An organic wave of Hoberman Spheres</h1><p>Currently on show at Berlin's NOME Gallery is the latest work by Nils VÃ¶lker titled Bits And Pieces. The installation consists out of 108 mass-produced toy spheres hanging in the middle of the exhibition space, individually addressable and controlled, to create organic waves that appear to move throughout the space.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/29c17de1db318a16ae7c090ab6a2dab8f308c76c.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>'Bike to the Future': Design Museum Gent considers a world of two-wheeled design.</h1><p>'Bike to the Future' is the latest testament to a cycling revolution we've been witnessing since the 1960s. But the Design Museum Gent isn't interested in the past; between 25 March - 23 October it showcases a collection of contemporary models from the new millennium, including Philippe Starck's electric bike 'MASS' or Tobias Knockaert's laser-cut bicycle, and prototypes and experiments for the future, with unusual aesthetics, materials and functions.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e75dd9b06e93c20d73aed8ffe8845b13b5208794.jpg"></article>]]></description>
